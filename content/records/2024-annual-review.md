Official documentation of the year's progress, challenges overcome, and lessons learned.

## Overview

2024 marked a significant year of growth and transformation across multiple domains. This record documents key milestones and strategic insights for future reference.

## Major Achievements

### Technical Development

- Established LEXI ARCHIVE as a permanent knowledge base
- Implemented robust content management system using Next.js and Markdown
- Developed Soviet-inspired design language that balances aesthetics with functionality

### Personal Growth

1. **Learning**: Deepened understanding of modern web technologies
2. **Creation**: Built systems that prioritize content preservation
3. **Reflection**: Maintained consistent documentation practice

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Information Overload

**Problem**: Too much scattered information across multiple platforms

**Solution**: Centralized archive with clear categorization (Fragments vs Records)

### Challenge: Design Direction

**Problem**: Finding a distinctive visual identity

- **Ownership matters**: Self-hosted > platform dependency
- **Design principle**: Form follows function, but aesthetics enhance understanding

## Statistics

- **Fragments published**: Multiple
- **Records completed**: This is the first
- **Technical experiments**: Numerous
- **Lessons learned**: Countless

## Looking Forward to 2025

### Goals

1. Expand archive content consistently
2. Implement remaining features (Guestbook, Dialogues)
3. Refine RAG system for enhanced knowledge retrieval
4. Maintain the discipline of regular documentation

### Technical Roadmap

- [ ] Complete all core sections
- [ ] Integrate AI conversation interface
