# Welcome

This is the first post in **LEXI ARCHIVE**. A place for scattered thoughts, observations, and fragments of knowledge.

## What is this?

This archive is built with:
- Next.js
- Markdown files
- Soviet-inspired design aesthetics

## Why?

Because information deserves to be preserved. Because thoughts deserve structure. Because the digital collective needs an archive.

### Technical Details

The system uses:
1. Git for version control
2. Markdown for content
3. Vercel for deployment

> "The future belongs to those who preserve the past."

More fragments coming soon.
